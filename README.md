# D3-Challenge
Repo for homework due December 1st

This main homework contains modified dynamic js/D3 code to render a static chart because I jumped into the dynamic 'bonus' excercise first and ran out of time to fully edit the basic rendering.

There is also a dynamic file included for partial bonus credit that allows for selection between two x-axis selections.

In order to render the dynamic file you must save/rename the appBonus.js file to app.js.
This is so that the index.html file will render properly as the code references app.js.

You will also need to bypass the CORS request issue by executing pyton -m http.server in the terminal.  This will allow your local host to bypass the CORS security setting and access the data stored locally on your harddrive.  

##Remember you need to be in the directory that contains the 4 files: index.html, app.js, style.css and d3Style.css.
